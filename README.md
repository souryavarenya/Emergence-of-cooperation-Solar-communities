## General Introduction

The diffusion of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems has the potential to decarbonize a large portion of the energy consumption in cities. However, consumers’ lack of awareness and uncertainty about solar PV hinder the diffusion the technology.

Opinion dynamics around the technology are thus of pivotal importance for understanding how policy interventions could accelerate the uptake of the technology.

Previous research points to the disproportionate influence of individuals with strong opinions – so-called “opinion extremists” – on other individuals within their social network. Such opinion extremists, therefore, provide a potential lever for policy interventions.

To investigate this influence, we have developped an agent-based model that represents a fraction of the building owners in Alt-Wiedikon district in Zurich, Switzerland. We simulate four scenarios with different distributions of opinion extremists to analyze their impact on the uptake of individual and community solar PV.

## The Model

The ABM represents the decision-making of building owners on whether to adopt rooftop solar individually or join a solar community based on economic and social factors.

The decision-making process has two steps, inspired by the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen 1991), where agents first determine if they develop the intention of adopting solar individually, of joining a community, or neither, and then implement the behavior (i.e., adopt individually or try to join a community).

The two most important variables to study with this model are the number of agents that install rooftop solar and the number of agents that join a solar community.
