## General Introduction

The diffusion of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems has the potential to decarbonize a large portion of the energy consumption in cities. However, consumers’ lack of awareness and uncertainty about solar PV hinder the diffusion the technology.

Opinion dynamics around the technology are thus of pivotal importance for understanding how policy interventions could accelerate the uptake of the technology.

Previous research points to the disproportionate influence of individuals with strong opinions – so-called “opinion extremists” – on other individuals within their social network. Such opinion extremists, therefore, provide a potential lever for policy interventions.

To investigate this influence, we develop an agent-based model that represents a fraction of the building owners in Alt-Wiedikon district in Zurich, Switzerland. We simulate four scenarios with different distributions of opinion extremists to analyze their impact on the uptake of individual and community solar PV.

## The Model

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)

## Fundamental Questions

(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )

## Expected Results

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)

## References

(Add the bibliographic references you intend to use)
(Explain possible extension to the above models)
(Code / Projects Reports of the previous year)

## Research Methods

(Cellular Automata, Agent-Based Model, Continuous Modeling...) (If you are not sure here: 1. Consult your colleagues, 2. ask the teachers, 3. remember that you can change it afterwards)
